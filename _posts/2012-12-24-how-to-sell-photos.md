### How to Sell Your Photos

You already know Alkaline is a great CMS for images, but it also makes selling your photos online just as easy. Since you run your own Web site, you have unrestricted freedom in choosing how to market your art. One easy way to get started is [Fotomoto](http://www.fotomoto.com/), which will handle the billing and production associated with marketing prints and related products of your photos.

###### 1. Register at Fotomoto

Go to [Fotomoto](http://www.fotomoto.com/) to sign-up. It costs nothing to join. When you're done, log-in to Fotomoto, and click the Settings tab. Save your "Store ID". You'll need it later.

###### 2. Install and configure the Fotomoto extension.

[Alkaline Labs](http://www.alkalinelabs.com/) offers a free [Fotomoto extension](http://alkalineapp.com/users/threads/fotomoto.10/) extension. Download it, unarchive it, and drag-and-drop the `fotomoto/` folder to the `extensions/` folder on your Web site. Log-in to your Alkaline Dashboard. Choose **Settings > Extensions > Fotomoto**. Copy your "Store ID" (from Fotomoto) and save the changes.

###### 3. Integrate Fotomoto with your Web site.

Unless you've heavily modified your Alkaline installation, your image pages will be served by `image.html` of your current theme. Open the `image.html` template and try adding one of the Fotomoto Canvas tags such as `{Image_Fotomoto_Buy}`. Save your changes and upload the template. Go to your Web site and see the new link. Now your visitors can quickly and easily buy your prints.
