### Simple Customization

Your Alkaline experience can be quickly customized in three steps:

1. Set your preferences.
2. Configure your installation.
3. Design your library.

##### Set your preferences

Choose **Dashboard > Preferences**. Preferences are set by individual users. Your preferences do not affect other users.

##### Configure your installation

Choose **Settings > Configuration**. The configuration affects your entire Alkaline library and all visitors, guests, and users. Configure your installation to maximize your efficiency and enjoyment of Alkaline.

##### Design your library

You can download additional themes at the [Alkaline Lounge](/users/). Prefer to design your Alkaline library yourself? Read [Themes and the Canvas Engine](/guide/themes/).
