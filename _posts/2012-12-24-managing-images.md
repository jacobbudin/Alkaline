### Managing Images

Individual images can be managed by choosing the **Library**. If you have a large library, find the image you're seeking by performing a search.

To change multiple images simultaneously, choose **Editor**. You can select multiple images to perform an operation on using the drop-down function selector. Choose a cluster of images by selecting the first image in the cluster and then, while holding down the Shift key on your keyboard, selecting the last image in the cluster. To determine the images shown in the Editor, choose the **Library**, perform a search, and then choose **Bulk Editor**.

Remember, all fields are optional and can be edited later.

<a href="./images/features/screen3_l.jpg" class="zoom screen_box">
	<img src="./images/zoom.png" alt="" class="zoom_icon" />
	<img src="./images/features/screen3.jpg" alt="" width="140" height="105" class="screen_s" />
</a>

###### Title

Beneath the image is a field to write a title.

###### Description

Beneath the title field is a text area to write a description.

###### Tags

To add a tag, type the name of the tag into the field and select **Add** or press Return. Remove a tag by clicking on its name.

###### Location

Begin typing the name of a city. Most well-populated cities will automatically be suggested. Using your keyboard or mouse, select the city. Continue typing to override the internal database and enter a city of your choosing. You can also use your own coordinates, for example:

	Oxbow, Canada (49.233333, -102.166667)

###### Publish date

Type any date in the past, present, or future--with or without a time. You can also use words such as "now", "today", or "tomorrow" as well as relative times such as "+7 days" to publish the image in a week. This field can also be left blank and will remain unpublished until you enter a date later.

###### Privacy level

The privacy level only affects published images. Unpublished images can only be browsed through the administrative dashboard.

- **Public:** Can be viewed by everyone.
- **Protected:** Can be viewed only by verified guests and users.
- **Private:** Can be viewed only by verified users.

###### Rights sets

Select a rights set to assign the photo.

###### Additional data

Most images will have drop-down panes of additional data such as the image color palette, thumbnail links, and an EXIF data listing.

###### Delete this image

Deleting a image permanently removes it and all of its associated data (including comments) from Alkaline. Additionally, the physical file is erased from your `/images/` folder. This action cannot be undone.
