### Using Features

There are many features to enhance your image library. View all the features by choosing **Editor**.

</a>

##### Tags

Tags are keywords you can assign to your images. You can navigate your image library by tags, as well as search your library with booleans (for example, `water NOT ice`). An image can have as many tags as you would like. To create a tag, type the tag while editing an image. You can also remove tags from individual images by clicking on the tag, or from many images by using the **Editor**.

Your tag cloud displays your library's collection of tags with individual tags' sizes determined by their relative popularity. Click a tag to rename or remove it from all images. Click the nearby image count to show its associated images. 

##### Sets

Sets are similar to albums, groups, or sets in other applications. Sets are groups of photos. There are two types of sets: static and automatic.

- **Static:** A collection of photos that are handpicked, and can be manually sorted.
- **Automatic:** A collection of photos that are selected based on a search, and is automatically sorted by the search criteria.

Static sets are good for collections such as "My Top 10 Photos of 2009" that are unlikely to be change over time and that need to be shown in a specific user-selected order. Automatic sets are good for collections such as "My Best Outdoors Shots" that will evolve over time and that can be sorted automatically (for example, by date published).

Create a static set by choosing **Editor > Set > Build Static Set**. Create an automatic set by performing a search (**Library > Search**) based on the criteria you want to the set to adhere to and choose **Build Set**.

Static sets never change without a user manually adding or removing a photo. Automatic sets update themselves as users upload new images that match your criteria.

##### Comments

Comments are user-contributed notes to your photo. They may be positive, negative, constructive, or otherwise. Some may be spam. You can label and remove comments as necessary. To control spam, use the Alkaline Labs' [Akismet]() extension.

##### Pages

Pages are static displays of content. Use pages to quickly add information to your Web site. You can use HTML to markup your pages. Alkaline extensions can add new markup languages and other functionality to Pages.

##### Right Sets

Right sets are explanations of the copyrights and related legal or purchasing data. You can assign right sets to individual images by choosing the photo in the **Library**, or to many images by using the **Editor**.
