##### General

<h6 id="how-much">How much does Alkaline cost?</h6>

<p><strike>Alkaline costs $79 per site. Alkaline Multiuser costs $249 per site. Liked boxed software, Alkaline purchases include lifetime licenses. To obtain licenses, <a href="./buy/">buy now</a>.</strike> As of August 2012, Alkaline is now open source software, and <a href="https://github.com/jacobbudin/Alkaline"> available for download for free on GitHub</a>.</p>

<h6 id="which-edition">Which edition is right for me?</h6>

<p>Alkaline is intended for individual photographers, and has no restrictions on type of use. Alkaline Multiuser is intended for businesses and organizations that have many users, but it may not be used in certain industries. <strike>In those cases, our most robust solution, Alkaline Enterprise, can be deployed. For more information on Alkaline Enterprise, visit <a href="http://www.alkalinesys.com/">Alkaline Systems</a></strike>.</p>

<h6 id="#why-web-site">Why do I need my own Web site?</h6>

<p>Alkaline installs on your Web site so you have absolute control over it. If our Web site becomes unavailable or we should cease operations, your Alkaline-powered Web site will continue to work just fine. Unlike &#8220;hosted&#8221; solutions, you never sacrifice the copyrights associated with your work.</p>

<h6 id="#how-difficult">How difficult is it to install? Can I do it myself?</h6>

<p>Installing Alkaline is about as difficult as installing a CMS such as <a href="http://www.wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>. If you&#8217;ve never installed a Web application before, we provide step-by-step instructions so that if you&#8217;re familiar with FTP, you should be able to complete the installation on your own. Otherwise, consider enlisting a tech-savvy friend to help you.</p>

<p>Additionally, we offer next business day professional installation ($39) should you need it. You can purchase services including installation from our <a href="./licenses/">users lounge</a>.</p>

<h6 id="how-many-images">How many images can my library contain?</h6>

<p>Alkaline is designed to handle millions of images. (Just make sure you have enough disk space!)</p>

<hr />

##### Compatibility

<h6 id="image-types">What kinds of images are supported?</h6>

Alkaline supports any image kind (whether it be a photo, illustration, etc.) and the most common image types including both raster and vector images. Supported file formats include: JPG, GIF, and PNG as well as EPS and SVG where ImageMagick is available. 

<h6 id="how-compatible">How do I know if my Web host is compatible?</h6>

<p>Our <a href="./compatibility/">free compatibility suite</a> will make that determination for you.</p>

<h6 id="alkaline-on-windows">Does Alkaline work on Windows&#0174; servers?</h6>

<p>Alkaline has been tested and is compatible with Windows&#0174; Server 2008. Be sure to use our <a href="./compatibility/"> compatibility suite</a> to make sure you meet all the other requirements. We recommend the URL Rewrite 2 module also be installed.</p>

<h6 id="do-i-need-adobe-flash">Do I need Adobe&#0174; Flash installed?</h6>

<p>No, neither users nor visitors require Adobe&#0174; Flash or any other proprietary browser plug-in to use Alkaline. Slideshows and real-time functionality are powered by JavaScript, which should function in any modern Web browser.</p>

<h6 id="file-size-limit-uploads">Why is there a file size limit on some types of uploads?</h6>

<p>Most Web servers are configured to reject uploads above a certain file size. In many cases, you can change your Web server&#8217;s PHP configuration to increase the limit. If you can&#8217;t, you can still upload larger files using FTP, SFTP, or WebDAV.</p>

<h6 id="gd-plus-im">Why do I need GD if ImageMagick is installed?</h6>

<p>Certain ImageMagick versions contain a software bug that affects image size calculation, in which case Alkaline can fallback on GD.</p>

<hr />

##### Ordering

<h6 id="what-payment">What forms of payment do you accept?</h6>

<p>We accept all payment types accepted by PayPal including MasterCard, Visa, American Express, and Discover (and all cards bearing their logos).</p>

<h6 id="what-merchant">What is the merchant name that will appear on my card statement?</h6>

<p>Our parent company <a href="http://www.budinltd.com/">Budin Ltd.</a> (Brooklyn, NY) will appear on your card statement.</p>

<h6 id="foreign-currency">How much does Alkaline cost in foreign currencies?</h6>

<p>The bank that issued your card will automatically make the appropriate currency conversion on your behalf. To get an estimate of the cost in your homeland&#8217;s currency, use an up-to-date currency converter such as <a href="http://www.xe.com/">XE</a>.</p>

<h6 id="refund-policy">What&#8217;s your refund policy?</h6>

<p>Due to the nature of the product, we can only issue refunds in instances where our compatibility suite falsely verified your Web space as being compatible and it was not. This refund policy is similar to that of most boxed software and virtually all digital goods.</p>

<hr />

##### Licenses

<h6 id="transfer-license">Can I transfer my license to a different domain name?</h6>

<p>Yes, log into our <a href="./users/">users lounge</a> to transfer your license. You can transfer any given license up to once every seven days.</p>

<h6 id="lost-license">What if I lose my license?</h6>

<p>Not a problem, we can retrieve lost licenses, even if you&#8217;ve forgotten your password. You can retrieve your license (by downloading Alkaline) through our <a href="./users/">users lounge</a>. If you don't have an account, simply use the same email address you used to purchase your licenses to automatically link your previous orders.</p>

<h6 id="phone-home">Does the software "phone home"?</h6>

Alkaline will never "phone home" (that is, contact the software maker) unless its license is invalid or missing.

<hr />

##### Legal

<h6 id="eula">Does Alkaline have a End User Licensing Agreement (EULA)?</h6>

<p><strike>Yes, all users must read and agree to abide by the <a href="./eula/">Alkaline End User Licensing Agreement (EULA)</a>.</strike> As of August 2012, Alkaline is licensed under the MIT license.</p>

<h6 id="privacy">What&#8217;s your privacy policy?</h6>

<p>We abide by the <a href="http://www.budinltd.com/privacy/">privacy policy</a> issued by our parent company, Budin Ltd.</p>
