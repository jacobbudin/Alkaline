### Compatibility and Purchasing

Before you purchase an Alkaline license for your Web site, you should ensure the software is compatible with your Web hosting environment. Alkaline works in any variety of different configurations--including shared, private, and dedicated hosting--but also has strict minimum requirements to function.

##### Requirements

Alkaline was designed for Linux-based operating systems (such as CentOS) running Apache 2 as well as WindowsÂ® Server 2008 running IIS 7. Alkaline should operate on most modern Web servers with little to no modification. Additionally, Alkaline requires:

- PHP 5.2+ with modules: GD, JSON, PDO (with appropriate database driver), SimpleXML
- A MySQL 5.x or PostgreSQL 8.x database, or SQLite 3.x support

Unsure? Let our [compatibility suite](/compatibility/) check your configuration automatically. The user installing Alkaline should also have rudimentary knowledge of HTML and previous experience transferring files via FTP. Also, additional RAM may need to be allocated to PHP in order for Alkaline to process very large images; your Web hosting provider should be able to do this for you.

##### Purchasing

As of August 2010, Alkaline is now open source software and <a href="https://github.com/jacobbudin/Alkaline">available for free on GitHub</a>.
